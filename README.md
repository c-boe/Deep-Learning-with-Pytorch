# Deep-Learning-with-Pytorch

This repository contains implementations of some examples of [Deep Learning with Python](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks) by Francois Chollet in Pytorch.

The examples present basic neural network concepts like convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, data augmentation and transfer learning and utilize torch concepts like dataloaders and custom datasets.

Each script can be run independently and in some cases require manually downloading datasets or word embeddings which need to be placed in the "data" folder. The scripts are seperated into different sections (by %##) which can be run and analyzed step by step (this can be done comfortabely by "Shift+Enter" e.g. within the Spyder IDE).
